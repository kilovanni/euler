Project Euler solutions. 

This repo contains my solutions's source code for the various Project
Euler problems that I have solved successfully. The solutions are in the state
where they were during the first successful submit. This means some code may not
be fully optimized nor organized. Expect strange and silly things, but feel free 
to explore and improve the code.

If some problem requires an external file to run, the file usually consists of
the text provided in the description of the problem in raw text.
